Flour and Water.  Just playing around with JS to make a calculator for home bakers.  Currently just trying out some different UI ideas.  Once I have something I like then I'll build it for real.  Current best idea is the drag.html one.  The other index.html effort is just too clunky with all those hidden fields.  Not intuitive enough.  The tricky thing I still need to figure out is on the starter.  I have to be able to change the 2 values, not just one.  Was thinking of superimposing boxes one is a % size of the other.  Both are draggable.  Seems doable.
